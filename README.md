# Global Terrorism Dashboard (DV4BA Project)

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing global terrorism patterns from 1970 to 2017 using data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The work was completed as part of the *Data Visualization for Business Analytics* (DV4BA) course in the Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics program at Nova SBE.

The dashboards explore terrorist activity through three key analytical questions, each offering a different lens on tactics, geography, and evolution over time.

- Maps regional success rates globally
- Compares effectiveness of weapon-target combinations
- Analyzes fatality trends and success rates over the decades

### **2. Which regions have the highest frequency of religiously motivated attacks over time?**
- Focuses on Asiaâ€™s top countries for religious attacks
- Highlights target types (e.g. places of worship, religious figures)
- Shows how frequency and fatalities evolved and spread geographically

### **3. What are the emerging hotspots for terrorist activity, and how do they correlate with changes in attack types or weapon usage?**
- Visualizes trends in attack types and weapon usage over time
- Highlights regional dynamics and evolving hotspots
- Combines time-series, pie charts, maps, and treemaps for a comprehensive overview
